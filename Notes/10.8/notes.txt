Notes: 
- h1 -- h6 --> also level of importance
- Tag refresh: 
    <em> 
    <strong> 
    <span> 
    <pre> -- NOT USED 
    <hr> <br> -- SEPARATION OF CONCERN
    <p> 
    <ol>
    <ul> 
    <li> 
    <section> -- group lots of content together 
    <div> 
    <article> -- content to be shared, newspaper articles, blogs 
    <aside> -- ads or sidebars 
    <header> 
    <footer> 
    THINGS WE DONT USE 
    <blink>, <marquee>, <b>, <i> -- alot of these are CSS 
    <a>
- How to structure HTML: 
    <!DOCTYPE html> <!-- or ! shortcut --> 
    <html> 
        <head> 
            <!-- Stuff the browser needs --> 
        </head> 
        <body> 
            <!-- Everything the user sees --> 
            <h1>Hello World!</h1> 
        </body> 
    </html> 

- New tags: 
    <nav> -- content to help user move around website
    <form> -- when you want to get information/data from user 
        different inputs: text, passowrd, tel, email, button -- MDN has full list of what type of inputs 

- Progressive Enhancement: 
    Most important to website building is the content/HTML 
    Next is presentation 
    Finally is client-side scripting 
    --> like a peanut m&m, html is the CONCERN
    
    - CNN regular site has 1000 requests over couple seconds -- not everyone can use 
    - CNN made CNN Lite which got rid of the presentation and client-side scripting to keep all the CONTENT
